# PiPlayer

Made on Pi Day 2014.

Prints the digits of Pi on your web browser one digit after another for as long as your computer can compute the next value.

Has a pause button, resume button, stop button, slider to adjust print speed, and a counter that says how many digits of Pi have been printed so far.
