# PiPlayer

Made on Pi Day 2014.

Prints the digits of Pi on your web browser one digit after another for as long as your computer can compute the next value.

Has a pause button, resume button, restart button, slider to adjust print speed, and a counter that says how many digits of Pi have been printed so far.

Computation is done by JavaScript, this is completely client-side (so the Spigot algorithm performance will slow down really quickly, but you can still have fun with it!), shout out to @s-shin for his JS implementation of a unbounded Spigot algorithm.

Have fun and feel free to fork to make cool things with this :)
